This is a "plugin" for the Video Disk Recorder (VDR).

Written by:                  Stefan Franz

See the file COPYING for license information.

With this plugin you can rip AudioCDs.


=========================================================================
Req.:
=========================================================================
All requirements of ripit.pl.
Special version of ripit.pl (Its in dir "commands").
a VDR :P



=========================================================================
Install :
=========================================================================
Install the original ripit ( http://www.suwald.com/ripit/ripitde.html)
I used version 0.34 (i think).

Install this plugin like the other :
Copy ripit-x.x.x.tar.gz to your plugins (where x is a placeholder)
tar -xzvf ripit-x.x.x.tar.gz
ln -s ripit-x.x.x ripit
cd ripit
make all

Now copy the lib libvdr-ripit.so-x.x.x to VDRs LIBDIR
and add -Pripit to your VDR command.

Edit the special ripit.pl ($cddevice and $svdrpcmd)
and copy the file into /usr/bin.

THIS IS HARDCODED !! IF YOU WANT ANOTHER PLACE , CHANGE THE
COMMAND IN SOURCECODE.

TAKE CARE THAT YOU OVERWRITE THE ORIGINAL (AFTER BACKUP) AND
THERE ISNT ANOTHER ripit.pl IN YOUR $PATH.
! After an updatedb you should find only one ripit.pl with
"locate ripit.pl"



=========================================================================
Usage:
=========================================================================
Go to setup and change your settings.
Before you can use this plugin , edit the
special ripit.pl and "maybe" create the output
directory.

Start the plugin from your menu and put the
AudioCD in device.
Now press red button (Start).
Now you can watch the ripping process live.
After some time the menu will close,
maybe i change that but hmm maybe not.
At least you get a message over svdrp.

After The process started , the plugin
need writeaccess to your /tmp directory.
It will write 2 files.
"ripit.process" while a rip process is running
and "ripit.log" for a log ;). This one you see live in the OSD.



=========================================================================
HOWTO CALL RIPIT EXTERNAL :
=========================================================================
To see which commands are buildin:
svdrpsend.pl PLUG ripit HELP

To see what command will do:
svdrpsend.pl PLUG ripit HELP START

If you want to start an external rip process :
svdrpsend.pl PLUG ripit START [device]
If device is not given , ripit will use the device from Setup,
otherwise if [device] exists, this one. 

If you want to call the plugin external or from a (mp3ng)commandsmenu,
put an entry like this in commands.conf/mp3ng_cmds.dat :
AUDIOCD-RIPPER? : echo "/PATH_TO_YOU_SCRIPT/SCRIPT.sh" | at now;

Content of SCRIPT.sh should be:

#!/bin/sh
/PATH_TO_svdrpsend.pl/svdrpsend.pl PLUG ripit MAIN
#EOF

Call the script whatever you like , maybe mp3ng_audiocdripper.sh.
If you got it working, go to setup and hide the mainmenu entry.
Or use the script inside the folder "commands" of ripit. lol




=========================================================================
=========================================================================
Afterall , its a quick and dirty plugin..
After ripped all my cds , i think i will never need/use it anymore. :D
The Aborting/commands are ugly and maybe dont work for you.

So , if its not doing the right job for you,
write an own plugin or use another way.

bye ..maybe the README isnt complete..so what......
IF YOU ASK A QUESTION OR SOMETHING YOU NEED A PASSWORD FOR
AN ANSWER , SO I KNOW THAT YOU (MAYBE FROM LAST) READ THIS README.

PASSWORD IS : "VISTA SUCK" .
