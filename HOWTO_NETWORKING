Req.:
ssh & scp

Install :
Make sure you can connect without a passwordphrase.
If you dont know howto setup your System , i tell you 
"ONE" way (no attention about security ,etc) in short words.
You will find better HowTos on internet.
To do this with root is the badest way you can do it but easiest ;).

VDR    = Hostname of your VDR (or IP number)
CLIENT = Hostname of your Pentium VIII_XP with GF10000 and 3 TB Ram (or IP number)


Open a console on VDR.

login as root:
#~ su ( hit ENTER and type your rootpassword)

#~ ssh-keygen -t dsa
If you will be asked for passphrase , hit ENTER (no password).

#~ Generating public/private dsa/rsa key pair.
#~ Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_dsa):
#~ Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
#~ Enter same passphrase again:
#~ ..blablabla

#~ cd .ssh
#~ ls
#~ id_dsa id_dsa.pub

Now let us copy the PUBLIC KEY! to the CLIENT :
#~ scp id_dsa.pub root@CLIENT:.ssh/tmp.dsa

This will only work if you have running sshd on CLIENT.
You will asked for a password. Its the root password from CLIENT.
The directory /root/.ssh should exists before you scp the file.
If not (ON CLIENT SIDE):
#~ cd /root ; mkdir .ssh; chmod 700 .ssh

Now open up a console on CLIENT.
#~ cd /root/.ssh
#~ cat ~/.ssh/tmp.dsa >> authorized_keys
#~ rm tmp.dsa

Now you can use ssh and scp without a password.
To test it :
Go to VDR and type :
#~ ssh root@client

Not working :
Check Firewall !
Is ssh daemon running on CLIENT ?
Another session is open ?
Configure ssh and sshd (maybe (/etc/ssh) )
Search for another HOWTO ;) !

Its working:
Search for a better HOWTO and use an useraccount.
Btw, as user its the same way but better use tunneling ,etc. or
i'll visit you. :P

Now go to VDR and setup Ripit like this ;
Encode remotely : Yes
Remote Options : --sshlist root@CLIENT --scp

If you have mounted your CLIENT , you dont need --scp
BUT make sure you have the same path for the output.
If you have setup that ripit use /vdr_daten/mp3/rips,
same directoy structure should exists on CLIENT.
Read the Readme from ripIT for further infos.
If you want to do this with more than one CLIENT:
Remote Options : --sshlist root@CLIENT,user1@CLIENT2,user2@BEDROOM --scp

Your VDR will transfer the wavs to the CLIENT , where the encoder do
the job. After that , it will get back the MP3 and delete the folder.
Best way is to copy the same ripit.pl on all computer and check if
you have the same same encoder,etc there.

bye (works here like a charme..thx to authors of ripIT)
